Expresso
========

Expresso primarily aims to be an alternative PHP, or more precisely another Java. And as such, it has similar syntaxes to those languages.
The language name "Expresso" is coined as a mix of "Espresso" and "expressive", meaning that it's easy for programmers to write a code in it like you're saying "I can write a code while I'm having a cup of Espresso" and that it's highly expressive. And as such, Expresso is designed to provide high readability and perfomance at once.
