# Expresso
========

Expresso primarily aims to be an educational programming language. As such, it has similar syntaxes to PHP, and Java.
The language name __Expresso__ is coined as a mix of __Espresso__ and __expressive__, meaning that it's easy for programmers to write a code in it like you're saying "I can write a code while I'm having a cup of Espresso" and that it's highly expressive. And as such, Expresso is designed to provide high readability and perfomance at once.
